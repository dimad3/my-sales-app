<!-- async pipe is a pipe that essentially does these three tasks:
  1) It subscribes to an observable or a promise and returns the last emitted value.
  2) Whenever a new value is emitted, it marks the component to be checked.
  That means Angular will run Change Detector for that component in the next cycle.
  3) It unsubscribes from the observable when the component gets destroyed. -->
<!-- <mat-card-content *ngIf="supplierObservable | async; else loading"> -->

<!-- With <ng-template>, you can define template content that is only being rendered by Angular
when you, whether directly or indirectly, specifically instruct it to do so,
allowing you to have full control over how and when the content is displayed -->
<!-- <ng-template #loading>
  <app-loading-bar [visible]="true"></app-loading-bar>
</ng-template> -->

<div *ngFor="let supplier of suppliers">{{ supplier.companyName }}</div>
